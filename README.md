# Rock-Vs-Mine-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Project

There is war is going on between two countries submarine of the country is going under the water to another country and enemy country planted some mines in the oceans mine are nothing but explosive that explodes when some object comes in contact with it and there can be rocks in the ocean so submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing mine or rock our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock so how this is done is submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks so this signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean to predict the rock and mine we use some types of algorithms like decision tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM.

ðŸš€ **Project: Rock vs. Mine Classification using Machine Learning**

I'm excited to share my latest project where I've developed a machine learning model to distinguish between rocks and mines. This project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training various classification algorithms to achieve optimal accuracy. Check out the repository for detailed documentation, code, and results!

I'm thrilled to announce that I've completed a machine learning project aimed at distinguishing between rocks and mines. This was an exciting journey that involved data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. Proud of the results and eager to share my work with the community!

ðŸ’¼ Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensuring clean and relevant data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and selecting the most impactful features.
- **Model Training:** Utilizing various ML algorithms to find the best fit.
